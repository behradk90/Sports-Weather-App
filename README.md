# Weather Stadium Finder
This is a personal toy project that aims to help users find football stadiums based on temperature and weather conditions. It utilizes weather data and stadium information to provide recommendations.

Please note that due to time constraints, certain functionality and features could not be fully implemented. The following sections outline the current state of the project and mention areas that require further development.

## Features
- **City Selection:** Users can select a city from the dropdown menu to view stadium recommendations based on weather conditions in that location.
- **Temperature Recommendation:** The app suggests suitable clothing based on the current temperature, wind velocity, and weather conditions.
- **Stadium Recommendations:** Users can see recommended stadiums based on temperature ranges and weather conditions. (Not yet implemented)
- **API Integration:** The project integrates with the Giphy API to display relevant GIFs based on the weather conditions updated from the Weather API.
## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Set up environment variables:
  - Rename .env.example file to .env.
  - Provide the necessary API keys in the .env file.
4. Start the development server: npm start
5. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
## Limitations and Future Enhancements
- **Temperature Range Stadium Finder:** The functionality to filter stadiums based on temperature ranges is not implemented yet. This feature would allow users to search for stadiums suitable for specific temperature preferences.
- **Conditions Stadium Finder:** The ability to search for stadiums based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy) is not implemented yet. This feature would enhance the recommendation system by considering specific weather conditions.
- **Testing:** Due to time constraints, testing was not implemented for this project. It is recommended to add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
- **Responsive Design:** The app's responsiveness on different screen sizes and devices was not fully addressed. Implementing responsive design principles would enhance the user experience across various platforms.
